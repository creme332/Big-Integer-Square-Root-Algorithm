# VedicSquareRootAlgorithm
Algorithm to calculate the square root of large numbers to any degree of precision efficiently.

Does not round off.
sqrt(42)=6.480740698
Squareroot("42",1)= 6.4 NOT 6.5
Compare with inverse square root algorithm. (Quake 3 algo)

Steps :

 - Start grouping from left. Group pairs of digits.
